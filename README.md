# GTSNet: Flexible Architecture for Activity Recognition under Budget Constraint

## Abstract

This program (GTSNet) is designed to perform the real-time sensor-based activity recognition. The GTSNet includes a Grouped Temporal Shift (GTS) module that allows the network architecture to be flexibly modified by predefining the theoretical computational cost.

This software is a PyTorch implementation of the proposed method. The original version of this program was written by Jaegyun Park.
